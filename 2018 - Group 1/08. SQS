SQS (Simple Queue Service):
- First AWS service launched.
- Distributed queue system.
- To queue/store messages that one component generates while awaiting to be processed by another.
- Used to decouple components of an application.
- Messages can contain up tp 256kb of text in any format.
- Engineered to provide "at least once" delivery of each message.
- Multiple readers and writers can interact with the same queue.
- A single queue can be used simultaneously by multiple components.
- Does not guarantees FIFO delivery of messages.
  . If your system requires order to be preserved, place sequencing info in each message, to reorder the messages when the queue returns them.
- SQS always polls messages (never pushes them out).
- Visibility timeout period of a message starts when the the consumer component has picked up the message from the queue.
- Message has to be deleted during the visibility timeout period to be considered as completed
  . If not, another consumer may assume that message was not finished processing and will pull it again and try to process it.
- Can do autoscaling.

Pricing:
- First 1 million of requests per month is free.
- $0.50 per million requests per month thereafter ($0.00000050 per request).
- A request can have from 1 to 10 messages, up to a max payload of 256kb.
- Billed at 64kb chunks. Each 64kb chunk of payload is billed as 1 request (a single API call with 256kb payload will be billed as 4 requests).

Exam Tips:
- Messages can be delivered multiple times and in any order.
- Default visibility timeout is 30 secs. Max timeout is 12 hours.
  . If visibility timeout is insufficient to process and delete the message, use ChangeMessageVisibility action to specify new timeout.
- Short polling (standard): Returns immediately, even if the queue is empty.
- Long polling: Doesn't return until a message arrives or long poll times out.
  . Use when required to retrieve messages as soon as available in the queue. Max long poll time out is 20 secs.
  . Polling in at tight loops is burning CPU cycles and costing the company money. How to fix this? Enable long polling.
- Fanning out: Create SNS topic and subscribe multiple SQS queues to that topic. Whenever a message is sent to the topic, SNS will deliver the message to all queues that are subscribed.
