Concepts and Components:

AWS Global Infrastructure:
- 16 regions and 40 availability zones (2016)
- A region a geographical area. A region consists of 2 or more availability zones (ie. AZ-A, AZ-B, AZ-C).
- An availability zone (AZ) is a data center.
- Edge locations are CDN endpoints for CloudFront. Many more edge locations than regions.

Networking:
- VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Virtual data center. (Isolated cloud resources).
- Direct Connect: Way to connect into AWS environment without internet. (Dedicated network connection to AWS).
- Route53 : Amazon's DNS service (53 is the port that DNS sits on). (Scalable DNS and domain name registration).

Compute:
- EC2: Most famous service, virtual server. (Virtual Servers in the cloud).
- ECS (EC2 Container Service): Highly scalable fast container management service that makes it easy to run, stop and manage docker containers on a cluster of EC2 instances (EC2 + docker). (Run and manage docker containers).
- Elastic Beanstalk: Easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services. (Run and manage web apps).
- Lambda: Allows you to run code serverless. You pay for compute-time only. (Run code in response to events).

Storage:
- S3: Place to store files (object-based). You pay for storage you use. (Scalable storage in the cloud).
- Cloud Front: Amazon's CDN service. (Global content delivery network).
- Glacier: Secure, durable and low cost storage solution for data archiving and long term backup (offline storage). (Archive storage in the cloud).
- EFS (Elastic Files System): NES in the cloud. (Fully managed file system for EC2).
- Snowball: Import/export service. Pay for on daily basis. (?).
- Storage Gateway: Service connecting VM to cloud based storage.

Databases:
- RDS (Relational Database Service: Different database services. (Managed relational database service).
- DynamoDB: NoSQL database service. (Managed noSQL database).
- Elasticache: Way of caching database services in the cloud. (In-memory cache).
- Redshift: Amazon's data warehousing service. (Fast, simple, cost-effective data warehousing).
- DMS (Database Migration Service): Way of migrating databases into AWS. (Managed database migration service).

Analytics
- EMR (Elastic Map Reduce): Way of processing big data. (Managed hadoop framework).
- Data Pipeline: Moving data from one area to another. (Orchestration for data-driven workflows).
- Elastic Search: Managed service that makes it easy to deploy, operate and scale Elastic Search in AWS. (Run and scale Elasticsearch clusters).
- Kinesis: Platform for streaming data in AWS. (Work with real-time streaming data).
- Machine Learning: Service that makes it easy for developers to use machine learning. (Build smart applications quickly and easily).
- Quick Sight: Business intelligence service. (?).

Security and Identity:
- IAM (Identity Access Management): Where you can manage users, groups, roles, etc. (Manager user access and encryption keys).
- Directory Services: Multiple types of directory services. (Host and mange active directory).
- Inspector: Allows to install agents to ECS instances and inspect them for security vulnerabilities. (Analyze application security).
- WAF (Web Application Firewall): ?. (Filter malicious web traffic).
- Cloud HSM (Hardware Security Module): Way of securing your cloud based infrastructure. (?).
- KMS (Key Management Service): ?. (?).

Management Tools:
- CloudWatch: ?. (Monitor resource and applications).
- CloudFormation: ?. (Create and manages resource with templates).
- CloudTrail: Way of providing audit access to what people is doing in the AWS platform. (Track user activity and API usage).
- Opsworks: Configuration management service. (Automate operations with Chef).
- Config: Service that provides AWS resource inventory, configuration history and configuration change notifications. Allows you to create config rules. (Track resource inventory and changes).
-  Service Catalog: Allows to create and manage catalogs of IT services. (Create and use standardized products).
- Trusted Advisor: Automated service that scans your environment. (Optimize performance and security).

Application Services
- API Gateway: Create, publish, maintain, monitor and secure APIs. (Build, deploy and manage APIs).
- AppStream: Allows you to stream your existing Windows applications from the cloud. (Low latency application streaming).
- CloudSearch: Managed service that makes it simple and cost-effective to setup, manage and scale a search solution for your website or application. (Managed search service).
- Elastic Transcoder: Media transcoding service in the cloud. (Easy-to-use scalable media transcoding).
- SES (Simple Email Service): Email service. (Email sending and receiving service).
- SQS (Simple Queue Service): Way of decoupling your infrastructure. (Message queue service).
- SWF (Simple Workflow Service): Helps develop, build, run and scale background jobs that have parallel or sequential steps. (Workflow service for coordinating application components).

Developer Tools
- CodeCommit: Source control service (AWS version of github). (Store code in private git repositories).
- CodeDeploy: Automates code deploy to any instance. (Automate code deployments).
- CodePipeline: Continuous delivery service. (Release software using continuous delivery).

Mobile Services:
- Mobile Hub: Way of building, testing and monitoring the usage of mobile apps. (Build, test and monitor mobile apps).
- Cognito: Allows you to save your mobile usage data. (User identity and app data synchronization).
- Device Farm: Enables you to test you mobile apps against multiple devices. (Test mobile apps on real devices in the cloud).
- Mobile Analytics: Measure app usage, revenue, tracking, etc. (Collect, view and export app analytics).
- SNS (Simple Notification Service): Web service to setup and send notifications. (Push notification service).

Enterprise Applications:
- WorkSpaces: Amazon's version of VDI. (Desktops in the cloud).
- WorkDocs: Storage and sharing service. Like dropbox. (Secure enterprise storage and sharing service).
- WorkMail: Amazon's exchange version. (Secure email and calendaring service).

IoT (Internet of Things):
- Platform that enables you to connect devices to AWS services and other devices. (Connect devices to the cloud).
