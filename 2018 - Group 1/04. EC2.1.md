# EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

Virtual Machines on the clould ( pay for the capacity you use)

## EC2 Instances
- On Demand : Pay fix rate by hour (seconds in linux) with no commitment
- Reserved:   upfront payment, for 1-3 year contract
              discount for the hourly charge
- Spot: bid whatever you want to pay for instance capacity, perfect for flexible apps start and end times.
              * when spot price is lower than bid  -> instance provisiones
              * when spot price is higher than bid -> nothing happens or instance is stopped/terminated
- Dedicated: Physical EC2 instance (server), licensing saving.

## Use cases for each one.
### On Demand
  - Low cost and flexible EC2 instance, no upfront payment or lonf term commitment
  - Apps with short term, spiky or unpredictable work load that can be interrupted
  - Apps being developed or tested for the first time

### Reserved
  - Apps with steady state or predictable usage
  - Apps that required reserved capacity
  - Make upfront payment to reduce total computing costs even further
  -- Standar Reserved Instance (RI): (Up to 75% off)
  -- Convertible: (Up to 54% off) capability to change attibutes of the RI (linux to windows, etc)
  -- Schedule: available to launch durint the time windows tyou reserve, fraction of day, week, month.

### Spot
  - Flexible start and end times
  - Apps that are only feasible at very low compute prices

### Dedicated host
  - Useful for regulatory requirements tha may not support multi-tenant virtualization
  - Great for licensing whinch not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments
  - Can be purchased on demand
  - Can be purchased as a reservation for up to 70% off the demand price
