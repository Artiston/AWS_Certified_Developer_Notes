#S3 PART 1 (Mariana)

S3 (Simple Storage Service)
- Place to store files on the cloud.
- Object based (flat files, i.e videos, images, pdfs, documents, not OSs or DBs).
- Files can be between 0b - 5TB.
- Organized in buckets (folders).
- Names must be unique globally (universal namespace).
- Data spread across multiple devices & facilities (designed to withstand failure).
- Simple web services interface to store & retrieve data.
- Secure, durable, highly-scalable (infinite scaling), cheap, unlimited.
- CDN: https://s3-<region>.amazonaws.com/<bucketName>
- When uploading, 200 HTTP if success.
- Largest size file you can transfer to S3 using a PUT operation: 5GB. After that you must use a multipart upload.

* Dropbox leverages on S3 storage.

Data Consistency Model for S3
- Read after write consistency for PUTs of new objects (when putting object in S3, able to read it right away).
- Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTs & DELETEs (when updating or deleting, & reading right away, may get the old or new file, because of the propagation time).
- Updates are atomic (when reading, get the new or the old, but never corrupted).

Core Fundamentals of S3 Object:
- Key: Name.
- Value: Data (sequence of bytes).
- Version ID.
- Metadata.
- Subresources: 
  . ACLs (access control lists), can be added at file level or bucket level, to control fine grained permissions. 
  . Torrent (s3 supports bitorrent protocol).

* S3 designed to sort object in alphabetical order. In a case with files with similar names, they will be stored in same area & can lead to performance bottlenecks, so consider adding some random letter/number to the beginning of the filename to ensure objects will be stored evenly across S3.

Basics:
- Built for 99.99% availability, amazon guarantees 99.9% SLA availability & 99.999999999% durability for information (11:9 durability guarantee).
- Tiered storage available.
- Lifecycle management.
- Supports versioning.
- Supports encryption.
- Secure your data using ACLs or bucket policies

Storage Tier/Classes:
- S3(Standard): 99.99% availability & 11:9 durability, for frequently accessed files. Designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities.
- S3- IA (Standard - Infrequently Accessed): 99.99% availability & 11:9 durability, for files accessed less frequently but require rapid access. Designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities. Cheaper than s3 but retrieval fee.
- Reduced Redundancy Storage: 99.99% availability & 99.99% durability, for data that is easily reproducible. Designed to sustain the loss of 1 facility.
- Glacier: Very cheap ($0.01 per GB/month), used for archival (3-5 hours to retrieve data). Independent service.

Charges:
- Storage
- Requests
- Storage management pricing (allows to add tags to control cost).
- Data transfer pricing (moving data around, replication, income is free but moving data not).
- Transfer acceleration (fast, easy & secure transfers of files between edge locations & an S3 bucket, over an optimized network path).

S3 Bucket Lab:
- By default, buckets are private & objects stored inside them too.
- Individual objects inside the bucket don't inherit bucket tags.
- Buckets can be secured with ACLs or bucket policies.
- ACLs: Owner, other AWS account, public access. For buckets & files.
- Encryption:
  . Client-side
  . Server side: with Amazon S3 Managed Keys (SSE-S3), with KMS (SSE-KMS), with Customer Provided Keys (SSE-C).

S3 Website Lab:
- If using Route53 with S3, bucket name must be the same as domain name (i.e for hotmail.com, bucket name has to be hotmail).
- Static website hosting: http://<bucketName>.s3-website.<region>.amazonaws.com
- Make html files public.
- No dynamic content allowed.
- Scales infinitely.
- Serverless.

CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) Lab:
- Way of allowing JS in one S3 bucket to reference code in another S3 bucket.
- CORS enabling/configuration must be done in the bucket that is being referenced.
- Update CORS configuration with AllowedOrigin equals to the URL of the s3-website that will reference this code.

Serverless Webpage Lab:
- When registering domain name, make sure S3 bucket name is available.
- Serverless is when vendor takes care of provisioning & management of servers, is responsible for capacity provisioning and automated scaling.

* Check S3 FAQ.

Polly:
- Text-to-speech recognition service.
- Limited to certain regions (US Virginia for sure).
- API Gateway: S3 website has different domain name than API gateway. Enable CORS so S3 can communicate with API gateway.

S3 Versioning:
- User permissions: Objects level and object permissions level.
- Accounts permissions.
- Public permissions.
OK - Cannot remove versioning, only suspend it. To remove version from a bucket, will have to create a new one and transfer object into new bucket.
- 2 version of on object means 2 objects in the bucket. Storage size will be the sum of size from all versions of one object. Versioning stores all versions of an object (including writes and deletes).
- When a version is deleted, it cannot be restored.
- When deleting an object, it can be restored (old console, go to bucket, show versions, delete delete marker).
- Integrates with lifecycle rules.
- Versioning's MFA delete capability (uses MFA) can be used to provide additional layer of security.

Cross Region Replication:
- Versioning must be enabled in both buckets.
- Regions for each bucket must be different.
- Only new/updated objects that will be replicated (not existing ones).
- AWS CLI required to move previous files from one bucket to another. Bare in mind that will only copy objects (not permissions).
- When updating permissions from an object, permission will be replicated??? Yes.
- Delete markers are replicated, deletion of a delete marker or deletion of individual version is not.
- Not possible to replicate to multiple buckets or use daisy chaining.

Lifecycle Management:
- Based on rules.
- Can filter by object prefix or tags.
- Can be used in conjunction with versioning.
- Can be applied to current versions and previous versions.
- Actions that can be done: Transition to Standard - IA storage class (128kb minimum and 30 days after creation), archive to Glacier storage class (30 days after Standard - IA).
- Can be used to permanently delete objects too.

Cloud front.

CDN Content delivery network that deliver web pages and web content depending on user's geo location.

	Edge location: location where content will be cached.
	Separate to the AZ/RG
	
	Origin: origin of the files that CDN will distribute.
	Can be S3 bucket, EC2 instance, Route53, ELB
	Common cases: S3 bucket, EC2 instance, EC2 instance with ELB
	
	Distribution: name given to the CDN, consist of a collection of edge locations.
	
	Example: there are over 50 edge locations all over the world
	
	User request a file, the request goes to the Edge location, if it is not there, the edge location do a pull from the s3 bucket for example
	and caches it.
	For the first users is not that fast if the resource it asks for is not cached, for the next user the resource will be already cached so
	the overall response is going to be faster.
	
	CDN can be used to deliver an entire web site including dynamic, static, streaming and interactive content using a global network of edge 
	locations, requests will be routed to the nearest edge location.
	
	It is optimized to work with the following AWS solutions:
	S3
	EC2
	ELB
	Route53
	
	Works as well with non-AWS servers which stores the original, definitive versions of your files.
	
	Web distributions: typically used for web sites
	RTMP: used for media streaming.
	
	Edge locations are not READ only, you can change a file in the edgelocation and it will be replicated to the origin server
	Objects are cached and held on the edge locations based on the TTL of the object
	Object can be cleaned manually, but you will be charged
	
Create a CDN
	
	Create our own dist Lab.
	
	Types of distribution:
	
	Web: web pages, HTTP HTTPS media files dist, objects CRUD thru web forms, live streaming
	
	RTMP: helps to speed up streaming of file using the Adobe Flash Media RTMP protocol, allows to reproduce a file even though it hasnt been
	downloaded completely to the edge location
		You have to put your media files in a S3 bucket
		
	Set the TTL based on how frequent your objects changes, manual clean is going to cost you.
	
	Restrict viewer access could be by signed URL or cookies, to control that only you can have access to the resource you are supposed to see 
	and noone else.
	
	Geo restrictions - configure what countries can access or what countries cant, not both. (whitelist or blacklist)
	
	*Invalidation - allows remove objects from all edge locations, it will cost you.
	
	Is not only for downloading but also for uploading
	
S3 Security and encryption

	All newly created buckets are private
	Configure access to bucket:
		Bucket policies (Apply to the bucket and content)
		ACL (Apply to objects)
	S3 configure to create access bucket logs
	Encryption
		-In transit: when you send data from your PC to the bucket
		SSL/TLs
		-At rest:
			Server side encryption
				S3 managed keys - SSE - S3
				Each object encrypted with a key / the key for each object is encrypted with a master key - AES 256 algoritm 
			AWS key management Service, Managed key, SSE - KMS
				Provide audit tools to see who decrypt encrypt
				Create a managed encryption key
			Server side encryption with customer provided keys, SSE - C
				You manage encryption keys
				Amazon manages encryption decryption
		-Client side encryption
				You encrypt your objects and upload them to S3 bucket
				
Storage gateway:

	Its a service that provides connectivity between on-premises software appliances cloud-based storage with AWS storage infrastructure, 
	the service enables you to securely store your data to AWS in a cost effective way.
	
	Data Center -> Storage Gateway -> AWS (S3, Glacier)
	
	It is installed as a VM (It is associated to an AWS account and it is available in the AWS console after activation process)
	
	Four types of storage gateways:
	
	-File gateway (NFS): store objects directly to S3
	-Volume gateway (iSCSI): block based storage, store OS, virtual hard disk
		-Stored volumens: store an entire copy of your data set
	 	-cached volumens: store most recent access data
	-Tape gateway (VTL): backup archiving solution, virtual tapes
	
	File gateway (NFS):
	
	Files are stored as objects in the S3 bucket, accessed thru Network File System mount point.
	Ownership, timestamps permissions are stored as object metadata.
	Once the objects are store in the bucket, all S3 features can be applied to it (lifecycle management, versioning, cross region replication, etc)
	
	Volume gateways (iSCSI):
	
	Virtual hard disk
	Data written to those volumens can be async backed up as point in time snapshots of the volumes and stored in the cloud as EBS snapshots
	Snapshots are incremental, only changed blocks are captured
	Snapshot storage is compressed to minimize costs
	
		Stored volume:
		Allows you to have the primary data in premise while backing it up async to AWS
		The data is backed up to S3 in the form of Elastic Block Storage snapshots
		Volumes sizes goes from 1GB to 16TB
		Multipart uploads
		Complete copy of your data on site, complete copy incrementally on S3
		
		Cached volumes:
		Uses S3 to store your primary data while keeping the most frequented accessed data on promises
		1 GB to 32 TB for cached volumes
		Minimize the need to scale up on promise storage while reducing latency for your apps on accessing frequent data
		
		Tape Gateway:
		Used for backup
		Durable cost effective
		Virtual tape library
		You can use already existing tape-based library to store on virtual tape cartridges that you create in the tape gateway
		You add tape cartridges as you need to archive data
		
		Summary:
		
		File gateway: for flat files, stored directly on S3
		
		Block based storage:
			Volume gateway: entire data set is stored on site and async backed up to S3
			Cached volumes: entire data set is stored on S3 and most frequent access data is kept on premises
		
		Gateway virtual tape library: used for backup and uses popular backup applications such as Netbackup, backupexec, Veam, etc.

Snowball:

	AWS exports/imports disk accelerates moving large amounts of data in and out of the AWS cloud using portable storage services for transport
	Instead of uploading from internet use a external disk to accelerate data transfer thru LAN
	
	Snowball:
		Petabyte-scale data transport solution
		256 encryption
		once data is transferred is erased.
		Only Storage
		
	Snowball edge:
		100 TB
		Compute capabilities and storage
		can be clustered together to form a local storage tier
		
	Snow mobile:
		Petabyte and exabyte scale data transfer
		
		Summary:
		Import export: you send your own disks and storage
		Snowball can do:
			Import to S3
			Export to S3
			For glacier restore, move it first to S3 then to Snowball
			
S3 Transfer acceleration

	Utilises the cloud front edge network to accelerate uploads to S3
	Instead uploading directly to the S3 bucket, use a distinct URL to upload to an edge location which will transfer then to S3
	URL sample
		acloudguru.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com
	
S3 Summary:

	S3 is object based
	From 0 bytes to 5TB
	Files are stored in buckets
	S3 is an universal namespace, names must be unique globally
	https://s3-(region).amazonaws.com/(bucketname)
	Read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects
	Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTs and DELETEs (needs propagation) (Try to access after deletion you could get an older of the object or even the object)
	
	Storage classes:
		S3 (durable immediately available, frequently accessed)
		S3 - IA (durable immediately available, non frequently accessed)
		S3 Reduced Redundancy Storage (data is easily reproducible, afford to lose, not mission critical, lower cost)
		Glacier - cheapeast, archive, wait 3-5 hours to get the actual data
	
	Core fundamentals
		key (name)
		Value (data)
		Version ID
		Metadata
		ACL
	
	S3 object based storage
	Not suitable for OS
	
	Versioning
	    Stores all version (You paid each version of the object)
		Great backup tool
		Once enabled in bucket, it can be only disabled, to remove it completely need to create another bucket and move the content there.
		Integrate with life cycle rules
		MFA delete capabilities for sec
		Cross region replication, versioning enabled in both origin and dest buckets
		
	Life cycle management
		can be used in conjuction with versioning
		can be applied to the current and older versions
		Actions that can be done
			Transition to S3 IA 
			> 128kb object size and older than 30 days after creation date
			Archive to Glacier 30 days after S3 IA
			Permanent delete objects
			
	Cloud front
		Edge location, separate to AZ/RG
			Where the content will be cached
		Origin, origin of all files that CDN will distribute (can be S3 bucket, EC2 instance, Elastic load balancer, Route53)
		Distribution, name given to the CDN and it is a collection of networks
			Web distribution, web sites
			RTMP, video streaming
		Edge you can read and write will propagate to the origin
		Objects are cached and held base on the TTL time to live, default 24h, set in seconds
		You can force clear cache, but will cost
	
	Securing buckets
		By default all newly bucket are private
		You can setup access control to a bucket by:
			bucket policies
			ACL
		Buckets can be set to create logs of activity for audit reasons, logs can be sent to another bucket
		
	Encryption
		Two types of encryption
			In transit: SSL/TLS
			At rest:
				Server side encryption
					-S3 managed keys - SS3-S3
					-AWS Key management service, managed keys - SS3-KMS
						Allows to have a master key to encrypt all the keys, also enable audit to know how the keys are being used.
					-Service side encryption with customer provided keys SSE-C 
					
			Client side encryption
				You upload the data encrypted to the S3 bucket.
	
	Storage gateway
		-File gateway, for flat files, stored directly to S3
		-Volume gateway:	
				Stored volume: entire dataset is stored on site and backed up async to S3, iSCSI, OS, databases
				Cached volumes: entire dataset is stored in S3, frequently accessed data is kept on prem
		-Gateway virtual tape library
			Used for backups and uses popular backup apps like Netbackup, Backup exec, Veam
			
	Snowball
		Standar snowball
			Only storage, varios sizes, 5TB original size, 
		Snowball edge
			Storage plus compute capabilities
			run lambdas
		Snow mobile
			100Petabytes
			Only available in the US
	
		Import/Export (Old fashion, you ship your storage devices to amazon to import export data)
		Snowball can import/export to S3
		
	S3 Transfer acceleration
		Costs extra, helps users who are far away from the bucket they are uploading to
		Uploading files to an s3 edge location, then the objects are replicated to the origin bucket
		
	S3 Static websites
		You can use S3 to host static websites
		Serveless
		Scale automatically
		Static ONLY, no dynamic
	
	CORS
		cross origin resource sharing
		Need to enable on the resources bucket and state the origin URL that will be accessing them
		Use the s3 website URL
		
	IMPORTANT
		Be able to recognize the URL from being the bucket URL and the website bucket URL
		
		Website URL
			https://(bucketname).s3-website.(region).amazonaws.com
		Bucket URL
			https://s3.(region).amazonaws.com/(bucketname)
			
	Lastly
		When you write to S3 successfully you get a 200 status code
		Do it faster by enabling multipart upload
