SWF (Simple Workflow Service):
- Service to coordinate work (tasks) across distributed application components.
- A tasks represents invocations of various processing steps in an application.
- Max workflow time is 1 year and always measured in secs.
- Consider SWF when human interaction involved, and delivery timeframes are longer than 12 hours.

Worker:
- Program that interact with SWF to get tasks, process received tasks and returns results.

Decider:
- Program that controls the coordination of tasks (ordering, concurrency, scheduling, according to the app logic).

Workers and Deciders:
- SWF brokers the interaction between workers and a deciders, allowing the decider to get consistent views into the progress of tasks and to initiate new tasks.
- SWF stores tasks, assigns them to workers when ready and monitors their progress.
- A tasks is assigned only once and is never duplicated.
- Workers and deciders don't have to keep track of execution state.

Domain:
- Workflow, activity types and the workflow execution are all scoped to a domain.
- Domains isolate a set of types, executions and task lists.
- To register a domain use Management Console or RegisterDomain action from the API.

SWF vs SQS:
- SWF task-oriented API vs SQS message-oriented API.
- SWF ensures a task is assigned once and never duplicated. SQS needs handling of duplicated messages and handling of messages to be processed only once.
- SWF keeps track of tasks and events. SQS needs an implementation to for message tracking.
