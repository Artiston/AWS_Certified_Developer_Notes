Chapter 79) Route53 - Register a domain

Its not part of the free tier

Domain registration may take 3 days to complete
You need the NS (Name server) record and the SOA (Start Of Authority) record

Chapter 80) Setup EC2 instances and ELB

Chapter 81) Routing policies

-Simple:

Its the default routing policy when you created a new record set

user -> route 53 -> EC2 instance

-Weighted

Route 53 can split the traffic and send for instance 20% to one region
and 80% to another one

Can be two different ELB in the same Region

Also is used to redirect certain amount of traffic to a testing env the rest to the actual prod env

-Latency

Allows to redirect traffic based on the lower network latency for your end user.
The latency routing based policies create a latency resource record set for Amazon EC@ or ELB in each region hosting 
our website, when Route53 receives a query for your website, it selects the latency resource record for the region that
gives the lower latency, Route 53 then respond with the value associated with that record.

Person in south africa -> 		route 53
						
					us-east-2				ap-southeast-2
					(latency 50 ms)			(latency 300ms)
					
					Route 53 will send
					the traffic to us-east-2
					
-Failover
This applies when you want to create a active/passive setup.
Like having a primary website in one region and a backup one in another one
Route 53 will monitor the health of your primary site using a health check

Health check is created in Rout53 dashboard

-Geo location
Lets you route the traffic based on customers geo location
Can be specified by continent, country or state(US)

Person in US -> 				route 53
						
					us-east-2					ap-southeast-2
					Route 53 will send			(South Africa Region)	
					the traffic to us-east-2
					
Person in Europe -> 				route 53
						
													Route 53 will send				
						us-east-2					eu-west-2
										            the traffic to us-east-2
                                
DNS 101

* Think of a phone book
* DNS translates IP and URLs to human friendly address
* IPv4 (32 bits) and IPv6 (128 bits)

*Top level domains

* Top level domain names are controlled by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)
* Domain registrars:
	-In charge of organize and guarantee unique domain names.
	-ie GoDaddy ...

* SOA (Start of authority) Records
	The SOA record stores information about:
		The name of the server that supplied the data for the zone
		The administrator of the zone
		The current version of the data file
		The number of seconds a secondary name server needs to wait before checking for updates.
		The number of seconds a secondary name server needs to wait before retrying a failed zone transfer.
		The maximun number of seconds that a secondary name server can use data before it must be either refreshed or expired.
	    The default number of seconds of the TTL file on resource records.


* NS Records
   Name server records and are used by top level domain servers to direct traffic to the content DNS which contains the authoritative DNS record.
   
* A records
   Is the fundamental type of DNS record and the A stands for Address
   The A record is used by the computer to translate the name of the domain to a specific IP address.
   
***ELB doesnt have a IPv4 or v6 IP address, it only has a DNS URL.

* TTL Record
	-Is the time that a DNS record is gonna be cached on the resolver server or the user own local PC, it is defined in seconds.
 	-The lower TTL, the faster DNS records changes take to propage thru the internet.
 	-DNS migration, drop the TTL to 5 min (Normally they are set to 2 days), wait 2 days
 	
* CNAMES
	-Canonical name: can be used to resolve one domain name to another.

* Alias record
	-Used to map resource record sets in your hosted zone to elastic load balancers, cloud front dists, pr S3 buckets that are configured as web sites.
	-Alias works similar to CNAME in the sense that you can map a DNS domain to another one.
	-Key difference: CNAME cant be used for naked domain names (Zone apex record), you cant have a CNAME for https://acloud.guru, it should be an A record or
	an Alias.
	-Alias resources save you time because Route53 automatically recognizes changes in the record sets that the alias resource record set refers to.
	-For example supposed that an alias record set for example.com points to an ELB at xxxx.xxx, if the IP address of the load balancer changes, Amazon route
	53 will automatically reflect those changes to example.com without any changes to the hosted zone that contains the record for example.com 
	 
* Exam tips:
	-ELB doesnt have a pre-defined IPv4. you resolve them using a DNS name
	-Alias record allows to resolve naked domain name to an ELB DNS address
	-CNAME vs Alias record, you will be charge if you make a request to Route53 thru CNAME, free if you Alias record
	
	
 	
   
	    
                                
                                
#Summary

ELB never dont have an IP4 address, only DNS name.
Alias record (You can resolve AWS components) vs CNAME
In exam, always select alias record over CNAME
