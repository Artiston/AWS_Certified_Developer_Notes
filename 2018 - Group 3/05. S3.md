# AWS S3 - Notes

[Prezi Version][1]

## S3 Essentials
- Simple Storage Service - SSS - S3
- S3 is object based storage (for flat files)
- No suitable to install and OS (-> EBS)
- Filescan be from 0 to 5TB
- There is unlimited storage
- Files are stored in buckets
- Read after write consistency for PUTS of new Objects
- Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propagate)
- HTTP 200 code for  successful write 
- S3 is a universal namespace (names unique globally)
	- https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/demobucket
	- https://s3-[region].amazonaws.com/[bucketname]


## S3 storage classes/Tiers
- **S3**: durable, immediately available, frequently accessed
- **S3 IA (Infrequently Accessed)**: durable, immediately available, infrequently accessed
- **S3 Reduced Redundancy Storage**: data easily reproducible, i.e. thumb nails
- **Glacier**: Archived data, 3 - 5 hours before accessing

## Key-Value store
- **Key**: name of the object, file name
- **Value**: data, sequence of bytes
- **Version ID**: versioning (duh!)
- **Metadata**: data about the data!
- **Subresources**
	- **Acess Control List**: Fine grained permission
	- **Torrent**: support bit torrent protocol

## CORS
- Cross Origin Resource Sharing
- Need to enable on the resources bucket and state the URL for the origin that will be calling the bucket
- Web Site URL
	- https://bucketdemo.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com
	- https://[bucketname].s3-website.[region].amazonaws.com
- Bucket URL
	- https://s3-[region].amazonaws.com/[bucketname]

## Versioning
- Stores all versions of an object (including all writes and even deletes)
- Great backup tool
- Once enabled, versioning cannot be disabled, only suspended
- Versioningâ€™s MFA delete capability, for an additional layer of security, web console
- Integrate with lifecycle rules (next)
- Cross Region Replication, required versioning on the source bucket (NEXT)

## Static websites
- S3 can host a static website
- Serveless
- Very cheap, scalable automatically
- STATIC only, con not host dynamic sites
