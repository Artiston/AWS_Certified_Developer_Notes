# Overview

## Some important aspects *(probably not in the exam)*

- Centralized control of your AWS account
- Shared access to your AWS account
- Granular permissions
- Identity Federation (Active Directory, Facebook, LinkedIn)
- Multifactor Auth
- Temporary access to users/devices
- Integrates multiple AWS services
- Supports PCI DSS compliance

## Critical terms *

- Users - Groups - Roles - Policies (Policy documents)

- Policies are in top, could be assigned to any of them.

============================================

## Some important aspects

- IAM does not have region

- New users have NO permissions

- Access key ID and Secret are to access services, NOT TO LOGIN.

- Good practice is to activate MFA

- Roles could be used for IAM user in another account or service (e.g. EC2)


=============================================

## STS Security Token service

### Sources
  - Federation (Active Directory)
  - Web Identity (OpenID, Google, Fb)
  - AWS account delegation

### Key terms
  - Federation: combining/joining list of users from one service to another
  - Identity broker: take an identity from point A to point B, you need to implement it
  - Identity store: Service like AD, fb, Google.
  - Identities: user of a service, Fb.

## Scenarios

### First Scenario

#### Flow
  Employee User/Pwd => Call identity broker => LDAP Directory => IAM Fed Token
  => Give tokens => IB returns credentials => Requests

### IMPORTANT FOR EXAM
  - When using an Identity Broker to communicate with LDAP and AWS STS, IB always authenticates with LDAP first, then with AWS STS
  - Application then gets temporary access to AWS resources

### Second scenario (Role)

- The same as first scenario, but in this time the application will use IAM role to interact with S3 (the request to AssumeRole will include the desired Role)
