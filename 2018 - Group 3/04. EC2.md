# EC2
- Provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud
- Scale capacity as your computing requirements change
- Pay only for the capacity that you actually use

# EC2 Options
- **On demand**: Pay a fixed rate by the hour (By the second for linux servers)
	- Low cost and flexibility without any up-front payment or long-term commitment
	- Apps with short term, spiky or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted.
	- Apps being developed or tested on EC2
- **Reserved**: Provide you a capacity reservation, and offer a discount. (1 Year or 3 year term)
	- Apps with steady state or predictable usage
	- Apps that required reserved capacity
	- Users able to make up-front payments to reduce their total computing costs even further
		- Standard reserved instances
		- Convertible
		- Scheduled
- **Spot**: Allows you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity. (If the price goes below your bid price, then your instances are terminated)
	- Apps that have flexible start and end times
	- Apps that are only feasible at very low costs
	- Users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity
	- **Important**: If you terminate the instance, you pay for the hour. If AWS terminates the spot instance, you get the hour it was terminated for free.
- **Dedicated Hosts**: Physical EC2 servers dedicated.
	- Useful for regulatory reqs that may not support multi-tenant virtualization
	- Great for licensing which does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments
	- Can be purchased On-Demand (Hourly)
	- Can be purchased as a reservation for up to 70% off the on-demand price

# EC2 Instance Types
- D - Density
- R - Ram
- M - Main choice for general purpose apps
- C - Compute
- G - Graphics
- I - IOPS
- F - FPGA
- T - cheap general purpose
- P - Graphics
- X - Extreme memory

# EBS
- Allows you to create storage volumes and attach them to your EC2 instance.
- EBS Volumes are “block device” storage <> object device (S3)
- They are placed in a specific Availability zone, where they are automatically replicated.
- You cannot mount 1 EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances, instead use EFS

## EBS Volume Types
General Purpose SSD (GP2)
- Balances both price and performance
- Ratio of 3 IOPS per GB with up to 10,1000 IOPS and the ability to burst up to 3000 IOPS for extended periods of time for volumes at 3334 GiB and above

### Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1)
- Designated fo I/O intensive apps such as large relational or noSQL
- Use if you need more than 10,000 IOPS
- Can provision up to 20,000 IOPS per volume

### Throughput Optimized HDD (ST1)
- Big Data
- Data warehouses
- Log processing 
- Sequence data
- Cannot be boot volumes

### Cold HDD (SC1)
- Lowest cost storage for infrequent access
- File Server
- Cannot be boot volume

### Magnetic (Standard)
- Lowest cost per GB of all EBS bootable volumes.
- Magnetic volumes are ideal for workloads where data is accessed infrequently, and apps where cost storage is important

- Each region has by default 1 VPC
- Each subnet is equal to 1 availability zone
- Security Groups = Virtual Firewalls
- Key/Pair: Used to decrypt login info to access your EC2 instance
- Instance monitoring is evert 5 minutes however you could enable the detailed monitoring (Every 1 minute)
- Termination Protection is turned off by default
- On an EBS-backed instance, the default action is for the root EBS volume to be deleted when the instance is terminated
- EBS Root volume of your default AMI’s cannot be encrypted, however you could use third party tools or create a copy of your AMI and encrypt it
- Additional volumes can be encrypted

- To login to your instance using SSH: ssh ec2-user@54.82.186.145 -i MyEc2KeyPair.pem

	- sudo su (Super User)
	- yum update (Update packages)
	- yum install httpd (Install Apache)
	- nano /var/www/html/index.html (Create index file)
	- service httpd start (Start Apache)

# Security Groups
- Virtual firewall, controls traffic to your instances
- An EC2 can have more than 1 Security group
- Any rule applied to a Security Group applies immediately!!!
- Security groups are stateful, this means that a request that is let in, will be let out
- All inbound traffic is blocked by default, you need to add rules to let traffic in
- All outbound traffic is allowed

# EBS Volumes Lab
- EBS and EC2 instances have to be in the same availability zone
- We can modify the volume type and size except for the Magnetic type
- We can create snapshots of a volume in order to move them from one AZ to another
- Snapshots exist on S3
- Snapshots are point in time copies of volumes
- Snapshots are incremental - this means that only the blocks that have changed since your last snapshot are moved to S3
- Snaps of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically, if they are encrypted you cannot share them
