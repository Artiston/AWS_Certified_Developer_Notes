# S3
- Simple Storage Service
- Provides developers and IT teams with secure, durable, highly scalable object storage
- Simple web services interfaces to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web
- Safe place to store you files in the cloud
- In storage terms there's: object based and block based
- Object based: videos, photos, pdf, documents = flat files
- Not to install an OS/DB on
- 0B to 5 TB
- Unlimited storage
- Files stored in buckets (folders)
- Universal namespace, names must be unique globally
- When creating a bucket, it creates a DNS address with the format:
  `https://s3-<region>.amazonaws.com/<bucket>`
- Receive a HTTP 200 code when file upload to S3 was successful
- Read after Write consistency for PUTS on new objects
- Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propagate)
- Updates are atomic: get the new data or the old data but NOT some partial data
- Key-Value store
  - Key: name of the object, file name
  - Value: data, sequence of bytes
  - Version ID: versioning (duh!)
  - Metadata
  - Subresources
    - Exist underneath an object
    - ACL: Fine grained permission
    - Torrent: support bit torrent protocol
- Built for 99.99% availability for the S3 platform
- Amazon guarantee 99.9% availability

## S3 Storage Tiers/Classes
### S3 - 99.99% availability / 99.99999999999% durability
- Stored redundantly across multiple devices un multiple facilities
- Designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently

### S3 - IA (Infrequently Accessed)
- Accessed less frequently but requires rapid access
- Lower fee than S3, but you are charged a retrieval fee

### Reduced Redundancy Storage
- 99.99% availability / 99.99% durability over a given year
- Used to store data that can be regenerated

### Glacier
- Very cheap
- Data archival only
- Takes 3 - 5 hours to restore from
- $0.01 per GB

## Charges
- Storage
- Requests
- Storage Management Pricing
- Data Transfer Pricing
- Transfer Acceleration
  - Enables fast, easy and secure transfers of files over long distances between end users and S3 bucket
  - Takes advantage of Amazon's CloudFront's globally distributed edge locations
  - As data arrives at a EL, it's routed to S3 over optimized network path
