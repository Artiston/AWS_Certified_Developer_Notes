Elastic Beanstalk

You can deploy, monitor and scale an application quickly
Provides developer or end users to provision application infrastructure in an almost transparent way.

A GUI for AWS
Infrastructure highly abstract focus, focus in components and performance, not configurations and specifications.

Applications are the high level structure in beanstalk.
Either an entire application can be an EB app, or each logical component can be an EB app or EB environment within an app.

Applications can have multiple environments: prod, staging, dev, or functional type (Front-End, Back-End)

Environments are either single instance or scalable
Environments are either web server environments or worker environments

Application versions are unique packages which represent versions of apps
An application is uploaded to Beanstalk as an application bundle - .zip
Each app an have multiple versions 1:N
Application version can be deployed to environments within an application

+ Applications can be split into tiers (web/app/db)
+ App can be updated
+ Config can be updated
+ Updates can be 1 instance at a time, a % of instances or an immutable update
+ You pay for the resources you use, but EB is free
