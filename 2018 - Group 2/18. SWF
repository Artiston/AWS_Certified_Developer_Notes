SWF - Simple Workflow Service

A web service that makes easy to coordinate work across distributed application components.

Examples: media processing, web app backends, business process work flows, analytics pipelines.

These are designed as coordination of tasks. 
Tasks represent invocations of various processing steps in an application: executable code, web service calls, 
human actions, and scripts.

Workers are programs that interact with Amazon SWF to get tasks, process received tasks, and return results.

The decider is a program that controls the coordination of tasks, i.e. their ordering, concurrency, 
and scheduling according to the application logic.

Workers and deciders can run on cloud infrastructure: EC2, or machines behind firewalls. 

Deciders can view the progress of tasks and can initiate new tasks in an ongoing manner.

SWF store tasks, assign them to workers when ready, and monitors their progress. 
Ensures task assigned once with no duplication. 

Workers and deciders donâ€™t keep track of execution state. They can run independently and scale quickly.
