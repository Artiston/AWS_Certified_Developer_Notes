- At the exam, under the security section

## For AWS Infrastructure Services:
- AWS is responsible for:
  - EC2, EBS and VPC run on the top of AWS Global Infrastructure
  - AWS Endpoints
  - AWS Global Infrastructure: securing data centers, 24/7 physical security
  - Foundation Services: Compute, Storage, DBs, networking
- Customer is responsible for:
  - Encryption, client/server side
  - Protect network traffic, send over HTTPS rather than HTTP
  - OS, Networking/Firewall configuration
  - Platform, App Management, your customer data

## For AWS Container Services
- Amazon RDS and Elastic Map Reduce (EMR)
- Only have access to the DB itself, not to the actual host, cannot SSH to the RDBMS host
- So AWS is responsible for:
  - OS, Platform, Patching, Networking configuration
- Customer is responsible for:
  - Data itself
  - Firewall configuration

## For AWS Abstract Services
- DynamoDB
- Lambda(?)
- AWS is responsible for:
  - Platform
  - App Management
  - Server side encryption
  - OS
- Customer is responsible for:
  - Customer Data
  - Client side encryption
  - Data integrity authentication
