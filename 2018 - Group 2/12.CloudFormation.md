# Cloud Formation
- Vast topic
- 2 Complete courses, 2-hour introductory course and a 12-hour deep dive

## What is?
- One of most powerful part of AWS
- Allows to take what was once traditional hardware infrastructure and convert it into code
- Gives devs and sysadmins an easy way to:
  - Create and manage a collection of related AWS resources
  - Provisioning and updating them in an orderly and predictable fashion
- It's about describing the environments with actual code
- No need to know the order for provisioning AWS services or the subtleties of making those dependencies work
- After deployed, resources can be modified and updated in a controlled and predictable way
- Apply version control to AWS infrastructure as with software

## CloudFormation vs. Template
- CF Template is an architectural diagram and CF Stack is the result of that diagram (what is actually provisioned)
- AWS resources can be created, updated, deleted by creating, updating and deleting stacks using CF templates
- CF templates are in JSON or YAML format

## Mandatory Elements
- List of AWS Resources and their associated configuration values

## Optional Elements
- The template's file format and version number
- Template Parameters
  - Input values that are supplied at stack creation time
  - Limit of 60
  - Like: tags associated to the EC2 instances, actual EC2 instances
- Output Values
  - Output values required once a stack has finished building
  - Like: public IP address, ELB address, etc
  - Limit of 60
- List of data tables
  - Used to lookup static configuration values
  - Like AMI's, etc

## Simple Template
- JSON
```javascript
{
  "Resources": {
    "HelloBucket": {
      "Type": "AWS::S3::Bucket"
    }
  }
}
```
- YAML
```yaml
Resources:
  HelloBucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
```
